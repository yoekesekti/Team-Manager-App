# Team-Manager-App
Team Manager App is a simple yet effective Java Swing-based application designed to manage teams, assign tasks, and monitor progress in collaborative environments. Built to enhance productivity, it streamlines team organization, member coordination, and task tracking.

Team formation is a crucial factor in determining the success of any project. Project failures are often caused not by individual skill gaps, but by poor team composition that lacks synergy, complementary abilities, and strategic collaboration.

To address this issue, Team Manager App introduces a recommendation system that suggests optimal team compositions based on three key parameters: individual skills, member availability, and prior collaboration history.

By utilizing graph-based modeling and implementing search algorithms such as Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS), the system analyzes the relational structure among team members to identify strong connections and maximize the potential for effective teamwork.
